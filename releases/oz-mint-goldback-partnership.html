            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>Element United today announced its partnership with Oz Mint, a Utah-based precious metals manufacturer now accepting ELMT tokens and launching digital certificates of authenticity for its Goldback legal tender notes through Element United's platform.</strong></p>

                    <div style="flex: 1;">
                        <p style="margin: 0;">Every Goldback purchased from Oz Mint now comes with a verified digital certificate. Collectors and dealers benefit from permanent, immutable verification of provenance, authenticity, and ownership—whether for ultra-limited collectible notes or investment-grade legal tender.</p>

                <p>Partnering with Oz Mint marks Element United's entry into precious metals authentication—the first of several planned expansions into luxury markets. Element United is positioning its NextHeir platform to serve high-value sectors, including fine watches, rare collectibles, and estate jewelry, with infrastructure built to scale globally.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Gold and blockchain aren't competitors—they're companions," said Scott Lomu, President of Element United. "Element United's digital technology makes that relationship visible, accountable, and immutable."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "Oz Mint clients value tangible assets backed by centuries of trust," said Oz Mint. "Now they get something equally permanent in the digital realm—verified proof that what they hold is authentic, traceable, and theirs. Accepting ELMT and partnering with Element United brings modern transparency to timeless value."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Element United now provides enterprise-level authentication infrastructure for precious metals dealers, while Oz Mint customers receive both tangible assets and permanent digital proof of ownership.</p>
