                <p><strong>Element United today announced a groundbreaking partnership with Tanzania following a meeting between Element United President Scott Lomu and President Samia Suluhu Hassan to advance an unprecedented initiative: protecting the Serengeti through digital verification of in-ground mineral assets via the CORE™ In-Ground Asset Exchange.</strong></p>

                <p>The project protects cultural heritage, critical biodiversity, and community landscapes through a "Preserve, Don't Deplete" economic model—recognizing natural capital without extraction. Resources remain in the ground, generating measurable value that remains within Tanzania rather than being exported, while ecosystems and communities remain undisturbed.</p>

                <p>Partnering with Jay Peters of TanzRoc Mining, Element United transforms verified in-ground resources into secure digital records—creating economic value without environmental harm.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "This is about proving that preservation can compete economically with extraction," said Scott Lomu, President of Element United. "If we can digitize value and keep it in the ground, entire ecosystems stay intact."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "Tanzania is committed to innovative approaches that honor our natural heritage while creating prosperity for our people," said President Samia Suluhu Hassan. "This partnership represents a new model—where conservation and economic development are not in conflict but aligned."
                </blockquote>

                <p>The initiative prioritizes community-led conservation, ensuring that economic value generated through digital verification flows back to protect the land and support the people who have stewarded it for generations.</p>
