                <h2>Element United Launches NextHeir — Blockchain Verification for Valuable Assets</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">Universal asset registry uses mining-grade blockchain to create permanent digital records for heirlooms, real estate, art, and legal documents</p>
                <p class="location"><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br>
                Salt Lake City, Utah – November 2025</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>Element United today launched <a href="https://ashandorbit.github.io/NextHeir/" style="color: #ffd700; text-decoration: none;">NextHeir</a>, a blockchain platform that creates permanent, verified digital records for valuable assets—from family heirlooms to real estate titles, wedding rings to wills, fine art to legal documents.</strong></p>

                <p>NextHeir creates immutable digital certificates for any asset that matters. Individuals and institutions can upload photos, appraisals, legal documents, and memory videos; share access with family, attorneys, insurance agents, or future buyers; and track ownership across generations and transactions. Each record is permanent, verifiable, and tamper-proof.</p>

                <p>The platform uses the same blockchain verification technology Element United developed to trace ethical gold from mine to market. By starting with assets people already care about—grandmother's ring, the family home, a Rembrandt—Element United is proving the system works before scaling it to transform how entire industries verify their supply chains.</p>

                <p><strong>The advantage: proven technology, personal scale.</strong> NextHeir applies industrial-grade blockchain verification—tested in global supply chains—to assets that can't be replaced: family legacies, legal documents, irreplaceable collections.</p>

                <p><strong>Enterprise-ready infrastructure.</strong> NextHeir supports individual accounts, family vaults, and institutional partnerships—with API access, volume licensing, and white-label options for law firms, insurance providers, and luxury brands.</p>

                <h3>Who Uses NextHeir:</h3>
                <p><strong>Families:</strong> Preserve heirlooms and settle estates<br>
                <strong>Legal & Financial:</strong> Titles, trusts, probate documentation<br>
                <strong>Museums & Collectors:</strong> Complete provenance for valuable pieces<br>
                <strong>Luxury Goods:</strong> Certificates and supply chain proof<br>
                <strong>Valuable Assets:</strong> Anything worth insuring or inheriting</p>

                <h3>Real Problems, Real Solutions:</h3>
                <p><strong>Inheritance disputes?</strong> NextHeir documents immutably—signatures verified, reducing conflicts before they start.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Lost appraisals?</strong> Everything's preserved permanently—no more missing records.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Provenance gaps?</strong> Fill them with verified, timestamped documentation that meets the requirements of collectors and insurers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Insurance claims?</strong> Your digital certificate is always accessible—proof when you need it most.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "After recent events, we've learned that even the world's most famous museums aren't secure enough," said Monsieur Poirot, Curator of Decorative Arts at the Louvre. "Thieves can take the crown jewels—but with NextHeir, they can't erase the provenance. Perhaps we should have been documenting digitally all along."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "I own art worth eight figures, and until NextHeir, my most valuable provenance document was a crumpled receipt from 1987," said Maximilian von Habsburg, Private Collector. "My estate attorney is significantly less stressed now."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "We built systems to trace gold from mine to market," said Scott Lomu, President of Element United. "NextHeir proves that system works—by protecting what already matters to people. Then we scale it to change industries."
                </blockquote>

                <h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
                <p>NextHeir is Element United's proof-of-concept for universal asset verification—demonstrating how blockchain can serve both individual legacies and enterprise-scale authentication.
