                <p>STRIA (Standards for Traceable Resource Integrity & Advancement) provides real-time verification of mining practices, creating an unbroken digital record from extraction to market. Certified mines gain verified proof of ethical operations—meeting evolving global and cross-industry standards for sustainability, transparency, and responsible sourcing.</p>

                <p>The partnership establishes a hemispheric network of verified mining operations, redefining how the Americas approach transparency, accountability, and interoperability in resource extraction.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "STRIA is not a stamp—it's a system," said Scott Lomu, President of Element United. "It's where verified sourcing meets verified accountability."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "Working with Element United brings enterprise-level verification to mining partners across Central and South America," said Dustin Minerals, Owner of Minerals & Extractives. "We're solving critical gaps in regional transparency while launching the infrastructure miners need to access global markets with verified credentials."
                </blockquote>
