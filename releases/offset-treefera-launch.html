                <p>Maple Credits represent verified carbon sequestration from the Green Portneuf Improved Forest Management Project in Quebec, Canada—a 5,111-hectare initiative transforming industrial private forest areas into sustainably managed protected forests through Logged to Protected Forests (LtPF) and Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) practices.</p>

                <p>Each credit was tracked from forest to ledger through Treefera's AI-powered verification platform, ensuring complete traceability and authenticity. The project, certified under the VM0034 Canadian Forest Carbon Offset Methodology v2.0, represented 43,832 tonnes of CO2e avoided emissions for the 2024 calendar year.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Our partnership with Treefera proves what's possible when data transparency meets environmental accountability," said Scott Lomu, President of Element United. "Offset™ isn't just a marketplace—it's climate infrastructure built on verified impact."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "Carbon markets fail when trust fails," said Caroline Grey, Co-Founder of Treefera. "By bringing verifiable, real-time data to every credit, we're proving that transparency isn't optional—it's foundational to climate action that works."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "Our partnership with Element United shows how first-mile transparency can transform carbon markets from speculative to verifiable," said Jonathan Horn, Co-Founder of Treefera. "Climate solutions scale when data becomes infrastructure."
                </blockquote>
