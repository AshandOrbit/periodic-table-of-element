                <p>Every TWOFIFTY piece—from bespoke engagement rings to couture statement pieces—now carries a digital twin through NextHeir, verifying origin, rarity, and carbon impact from mine to masterpiece.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Great jewelry has always told a story," said Scott Lomu, President of Element United. "Now that story is preserved forever—not in a safe deposit box, but in the fabric of the blockchain itself. TWOFIFTY understands that true luxury demands transparency as exquisite as the piece itself."
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    "When I design for a woman, I'm crafting her legacy," said Sarah Wilson, co-founder and creative force behind TWOFIFTY. "Element United protects that legacy with the same devotion I pour into every setting, every stone, every detail."
                </blockquote>

                <p>TWOFIFTY's partnership positions Element United to serve the custom, handcrafted, and prestige luxury goods sector at scale—with infrastructure designed for high-volume authentication and global brand integration across exclusive markets.</p>
